# üèà SimSN Interface 2.0

**SimSN Interface 2.0** is a modern, responsive frontend for managing online simulation leagues run by the [Simulation Sports Network (SimSN)](https://www.simulationsports.net).  
This app serves as the hub for SimSN‚Äôs **College Football, Pro Football, College Basketball, Pro Basketball**, and our upcoming **College & Pro Hockey** leagues.

This project is a complete overhaul of our original web application, redesigned with **user experience**, **developer onboarding**, and **scalability** in mind. The development of this project is for educational purposes for bettering our software engineering skills and providing a community solution for a passion project. This project is absolutely free and will remain free at no cost.
